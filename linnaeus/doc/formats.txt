PMC INDEX FILE FORMAT:
   The PMC index file should be a comma-separated value file on the following format:
   
   pmcid,pmid,path,has xml,has xml body,has ocr (.txt),has pdf2text (.pdf.txt),is oa,type
   
   pmcid: the main document id
   pmid: the equivalent medline id, or 0 if there is none
   path: the path to the article, under the base directory and not including any file extensions. Example: pmcids_100/pmcA1268100
   has xml: denotes whether there is an xml file at location e.g. basedir/pmcids_100/pmcA1268100.xml (value 1 or 0)
   has xml body: shows whether the xml file has any main text body (many do not)
   has ocr (.txt): many articles were OCR'd from non-digital articles. This shows if there is a text file at e.g. 
   basedir/pmcids_100/pmcA1268100.txt which should be processed
   has pdf2text (.pdf.txt): other articles have been produced from pdf documents. This shows if there is a text file at e.g.
   basedir/pmcids_100/pmcA1268100.pdf.txt which should be processed.
   is oa: shows whether the article is part of the open access subset or not
   type: show the type of the article
      
   Lines starting with the hash sign ('#') are ignored.
   
MEDLINE INDEX FILE FORMAT:
   MEDLINE XML files are very large (containing many documents), so an index file is used to show where each article starts
   and ends in each file. The MEDLINE index file should be a comma-separated value file on the following format:
   
   pmid,path,start,end
   
   pmid: the main document id
   path: the path to the xml file, under the base directory and not including any file extensions. Example: 2009/medline09n0001.xml
   start: how many characters into the xml file the article starts (linebreaks are not counted)
   end: how many characters into the xml file the article ends (linebreaks are not counted)
   
   Lines starting with the hash sign ('#') are ignored.
   
REGULAR EXPRESSION DICTIONARY FILE FORMAT:
Dictionaries should contain two (or optionally three) fields, separated by a tab character:
	entity id
	regular expression
	(comment - this can be utilized if the user wants to construct custom matchers)

Example:
species:ncbi:9606	([Hh]umans?)|(Homo sapiens)|(H. sapiens)

ENTITY NAME VARIANT DICTIONARY FILE FORMAT:
Dictionaries should contain two (or optionally three) fields, separated by a tab character:
	entity id
	name variant(s), separated by a pipe character ("|")
	(comment - this can be utilized if the user wants to construct custom matchers)

Example:
species:ncbi:9606	Human|human|Humans|humans|Homo sapiens|H. sapiens
