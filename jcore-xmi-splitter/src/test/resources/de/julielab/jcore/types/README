These copies of some (not all!) JCoRe type system descriptors only serve for testing of the XMI splitter.
The splitter (and builder) are not tied to any specific type system. Do not use the files in this directory
for production in any way. The JCoRe type system is found in the https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-base/
repository and available via Maven with the coordinates de.julielab:jcore-types:<version>.
We do not refer to the Maven artifact in this project because this would introduce a cyclic dependency between
jcore-base and jcore-dependencies.
