              sofaString="Allo-class I-reactive CD4-CD8- T cell hybridomas recognize the conformational change of class I molecule resulting from the exchange of the alpha 3 domain.&#10;&#10;H-2Kb-reactive, interleukin (IL) 2-producing T cell hybridomas possessing neither CD8 nor CD4 molecules were employed for the study of allorecognition on interspecies hybrid antigens by T cells in the absence of an influence of these accessory molecules. Both HTB176.10 and HTB177.2 T cell hybridomas reacted with KbKbB7 hybrid antigens as well as Kb antigens and they produced more IL2 in response to Kb antigens than KbKbB7 hybrid antigens. IL2 production of these T cell hybridomas was dependent on the surface expression level of Kb molecules on stimulators. Therefore, L cells expressing almost equivalent levels of Kb or hybrid antigens were selected for further functional studies by these T cell hybridomas. They apparently produced less IL2 in response not only to interspecies hybrid antigens but also to interspecies hybrid antigens in response to Kb antigens. These results indicated that T cell hybridomas recognized the conformational change of class I molecule resulting from the exchange of the alpha 3 domain via their T cell receptors.&#10;" />
