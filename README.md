# JCoRe Dependencies

JCoRe Dependencies features projects that are necessary to satisfy all dependencies for JCoRe Base.
It consists of self developed tools, slightly modified tools and redistributed tools to enable proper Maven usage.
The versioning of the individual projects is therefore not on par with our overall JCoRe version but every JCoRe Base release will also be accompanied by a JCoRe Dependencies release that comprises compatible dependencies.
