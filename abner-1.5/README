Thank you.

================================================================
COMPILING THE CODE
================================================================

First, make sure you have the following tools installed and working:

  o Java SDK 1.4 - http://java.sun.com/j2ee/download.html
  o MALLET 0.3.1 - http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/
  o JLex - http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/

Next, you will need to edit variables in the "Makefile" to reflect
where the appropriate tools are installed on your system. After that,
simply enter the command:

	% make

And that should do it.

NOTE: The trained CRF model files are *not* included with the source
distribution (to minimize file size and redundancy). You may use the
API to train your own models, or download "abner.jar" from the project
website extract the default models with the command:

	% jar xf abner.jar abner/resources/*crf

================================================================
USING THE API
================================================================

This distribution includes two simple files that illustrate basic
functionality of ABNER's API:

  o TaggingExample.java
  o TrainingExample.java
